# data-elections
Data analytics code with election data. All code is experimental and educational. 

#  Pandas Experiment

use the election data on a per county/per party votes.
use pandas library and also custom code to experiment with data.

Custom code reads the CSV files and since the format is clear 
enough, produces a number of json files with some transformation.

Pandas does the same, but with a lot less code and some 
transformation operations scuh as aggregation, filtering and
reducing.


# Next Steps

- find a way to automatically identify the counties to focus on
- find the precinct level data and check how 2024 transformed.
- which precincts increased in population or voter turnout, and how
  those precincts voted
- obtain precinct level voter turnout for areas such as 
  - school board etc
  - see which of those people or positions are party-oriented or
    non-partisan, speficially look up the county DA or judges
  - find which of the bond/tax propositions passed
- based on precinct data, predict the party leaning and the
  kind of messaging they may need
- find the county and see if there are any radio/podcasts out of that
  area, find the demographics
